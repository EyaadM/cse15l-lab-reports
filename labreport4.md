Keys pressed: <up><enter>
  
The ssh command was up only one in the search history, so I used the up arrow to access it. This command is what I used to log into the virtual machine. Thanks to ssh keys, I didn't need to enter my password.
  
## Step 5

Keys pressed: git clone git@github.com:EyaadM/lab7.git<enter>
  
I didn't use the up arrow to access this command and instead just wrote it out. This cloned the lab repository that contains the java file and the tester java file.
  
## Step 6

Keys pressed: cd lab7<enter>, <up><up><up><up><up><enter>, <up><up><up><up><up><enter>
  
I first entered the lab7 directory with cd lab7. The javac command was up 5 commands in the search history so I accessed this with the up arrow. Same with the java command. These comamnds ran the tests and the failure showed that there was a problem with the java file we are testing.
  
## Step 7

Keys pressed: <up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>
  
This sed command was up 7 commands in the search history so I accessed this with the up arrow. This command replaces the error on line 43, replacing the incorrectly placed index1 with index2.

## Step 8

Keys pressed: <up><up><up><enter>, <up><up><up><enter>

The javac command was up 3 commands in the search history so I accessed this with the up arrow. Same with the java command. These comamnds ran the tests again and showed that the error had been fixed as both tests passed this time.

## Step 9

Keys pressed: git add ListExa<tab>.j<tab><enter>, git commit -m "Updated"<enter>, git push<enter>
  
I used shortcut commands to add the ListExamples.java file faster. These commands helped update my github repository with the correct code, replacing the error.
